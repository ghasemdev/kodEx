Before planning:

If an optimizer or MCP-backed Memory Hub is available, use `/speckit.memory-md.prepare-context` or the MCP tools exposed by `spec-kit-memory-hub`; do not shell out to `npx memory-hub` directly.

Read:
- config, including retrieval budgets
- Governance Layer (`.specify/memory/`) constitution, standards, or principles first
- feature spec
- `{specs_root}/<feature>/{feature_memory_filename}` when present
- `{memory_root}/INDEX.md`
- existing `{specs_root}/<feature>/{memory_synthesis_filename}` when present

When `optimizer.enabled` is `true` and the MCP server is available:
1. Call `speckit_memory_refresh_cache(scope="all")` if the scope may have changed.
2. Call `speckit_memory_synthesize(feature="specs/<feature>")` to generate or refresh `{specs_root}/<feature>/{memory_synthesis_filename}`.
3. Read `{specs_root}/<feature>/{memory_synthesis_filename}` first.
4. Open additional durable memory files only when synthesis is insufficient or audit mode is requested.
5. Surface the token comparison banner (`Baseline`, `Cached flow`, `Saved`) so the optimization benefit stays visible in normal planning runs.

Select relevant index entries first, then read only the smallest necessary source sections. Do not read or paste entire durable memory files unless the index is missing, incomplete, or the user explicitly requests a full audit.
Do not load all durable memory files during normal planning when the optimizer is enabled.

Produce or refresh `{specs_root}/<feature>/{memory_synthesis_filename}` using only:
- relevant project context
- current constraints
- reused decisions
- relevant bug patterns
- architecture boundaries
- feature-to-memory conflicts
- assumptions requiring confirmation
- implementation watchpoints
- verification watchpoints

Required synthesis structure (match this exactly):

```markdown
# Memory Synthesis

## Current Scope
[Brief description of feature scope and affected modules]

## Relevant Decisions
- [D1] [Decision] (Reason Included: [X], Status: [Y], Source: [Z])

## Active Architecture Constraints
- [A1] [Constraint] (Reason Included: [X], Source: [Z])

## Accepted Deviations
- [Deviation] (Reason Included: [X], Status: Accepted-Deviation)

## Relevant Security Constraints
- [C1] [Constraint] (Reason Included: [X], Source: security-constraints.md)

## Related Historical Lessons
- [B1] [Lesson] (Reason Included: [X])

## Conflict Warnings
- [Explicit conflicts between old and new memory]

## Retrieval Notes
- [Index entries considered, source sections read, budget status]
```

Format rules:
- keep every required section, even when empty
- use `- [none]` for empty sections
- use stable item IDs such as `[C1]`, `[D1]`, `[B1]`, `[A1]`, `[Q1]`, `[W1]`, `[V1]`
- keep conflict counts aligned with the listed conflicts
- keep the synthesis within `retrieval.max_synthesis_words` defaulting to 900 words
- if retrieval budgets are exceeded, summarize and prioritize instead of reading more memory

Block progress on unresolved hard conflicts.
Warn on soft conflicts.
Keep the synthesis compact and directly usable in planning and implementation.
