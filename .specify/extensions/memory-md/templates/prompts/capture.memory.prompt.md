Review completed work using:
- spec, plan, tasks
- implementation diff
- tests or verification
- review findings
- incident context when available

Capture is manual and human-approved. Show proposed durable entries and matching `{memory_root}/INDEX.md` rows first, then ask for approval before writing.

### Duplicate Prevention (run before proposing)

When `optimizer.enabled` is `true`:
1. Call `speckit_memory_refresh_cache(scope="memory")`.
2. Call `speckit_memory_search(query="architecture constraints boundaries decisions <topic>")` for candidate topics.
3. Review results — do NOT read durable memory files directly. Search results are the authoritative dedup source.

When the optimizer is disabled, read `{memory_root}/INDEX.md` and the relevant source sections to check for existing entries.

### Entry Criteria

Update durable memory only when a lesson is:
- durable
- actionable
- non-obvious
- evidenced
- correctly scoped
- concise

Every entry must explain:
- why this is durable
- what future mistake it prevents
- what evidence supports it
- where maintainers should look next

### File Routing

| File | Use for |
|---|---|
| `DECISIONS.md` | Active cross-feature choices and tradeoffs |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Durable boundaries or system constraints |
| `BUGS.md` | Repeatable failure modes and prevention rules |
| `WORKLOG.md` | High-value project milestones (prepend, newest-first) |

### ID Convention

Use a letter prefix + sequential number. Count existing entries in `INDEX.md` with that prefix and add 1.

| Prefix | File |
|---|---|
| `A` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `B` | `BUGS.md` |
| `D` | `DECISIONS.md` |
| `W` | `WORKLOG.md` |

### INDEX.md Size Guard

Before writing, count existing `|`-prefixed table rows in `INDEX.md`. If the count exceeds 50, warn the user and recommend running `/speckit.memory-md.audit` to review stale or duplicate entries before adding more. Do not remove `INDEX.md` rows automatically.

### Registration

When the optimizer is available, use `speckit_memory_register` to write the entry, update `INDEX.md`, and sync the SQLite cache in a single MCP call:

```text
speckit_memory_register(
  id="<ID>",
  title="<Short title>",
  tags="<tag1,tag2>",
  file="<SourceFile.md>",
  status="active",
  content="### YYYY-MM-DD - <Title>
..."
)
```

Set `prepend=true` for `WORKLOG.md` only (newest-first order).

When the optimizer is disabled, write the entry manually using the `### YYYY-MM-DD - Title` format, then update `INDEX.md`.

When writing durable memory, update `{memory_root}/INDEX.md` with compact routing metadata that points to the source entry.
Reject changelog-style, speculative, or feature-local updates.
